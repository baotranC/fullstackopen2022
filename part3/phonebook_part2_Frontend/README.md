# Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

## phonebook

This frontend application communicates with the backend server (Heroku server) to manage a phonebook: addition, modification, deletion and filter of a contact.

This section teaches how to do a production build of an application created with create-react-app.
This section also teaches how to add a proxy so that the frontend application works in development and production mode.
